Access to the EchoNet dataset is credentialed, and open distribution is not permitted. As such, we have redacted the echocardiogram data used for this project in this public repo.

Contents would be:
* `all` - all echocardiogram videos
* `train` - train set of echocardiogram videos
* `train_batched_downsampled` - batched and downsampled training videos
* `val` - validation set of echocardiogram videos
* `test` - test set of echocardiogram videos
