Here we develop 

Another version of this repository can be found on contributor `VasuKaker`'s Github: https://github.com/VasuKaker/ML4H_Team_Echo

Contents:
* `data_modifiers` - scripts for distributing and balancing echocardiogram data
* `datasets` - contains echocardiogram video data. Open distribution of the EchoNet dataset is not permitted, so for this public repository we have redacted this data.
* `helpers` - helper functions
* `models` - contains both binary classification (EF above or below 40%) and continuous EF regressor models
* `FileList.csv` - table containing metadata on echocardiogram videos, including EF labels, framelength, and assigned train-val-test split
